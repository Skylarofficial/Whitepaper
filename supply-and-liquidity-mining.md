# ℹ️ Supply and Liquidity mining

#### LIQUIDITY MINING

Skylar enables liquidity mining rewards to incentivize borrowing and depositing. Rewards are distributed in $SKLR tokens, and the amount varies for each asset. The APY represents the compounding interest earned, while the APR denotes non-compounding rewards from liquidity mining.

#### MINING AND CIRCULATION

**Initial Liquidity**

2.5% of the total token supply will be added to an Automated Market Maker (AMM) for $SKLR.

**Liquidity Mining**

50% of the total token supply will be mined through block emissions since launch. $SKLR can be claimed at any time.

**Emissions**

50,000 new $SKLR tokens will be emitted daily for the first two years, with 40% reserved for staking rewards distributed weekly.

**Emissions for veSKLR Holders**

70,000 new $SKLR tokens will be distributed to veSKLR holders every Thursday. Emissions halve every two years.
