# ðŸ‘‰ Skylar Functions

#### BASIC FUNCTIONS OF SKYLAR FINANCE

Skylar enables depositors to earn interest and borrowers to leverage assets without selling them. Depositors receive sTokens, which generate lending fee income as assets are borrowed. Users can withdraw assets as long as they are not actively being used to borrow and withdrawal would not cause a loan liquidation. The protocolâ€™s algorithmic system adjusts earning rates based on market conditions, ensuring a fair return on investment.

#### EARNING INTEREST

We guarantee depositors continuous interest on their assets. The protocol employs a sophisticated algorithmic system to adjust earning rates based on market conditions, ensuring a fair and efficient return on investment.

sTokens represent the user's asset balance and appreciate as interest is earned, creating a compelling incentive for depositors to invest in the protocol and reap the rewards of their investment.

In summary, Skylar finance is a highly secure and reliable platform for depositors seeking to earn continuous interest on their assets. The protocol's algorithmic system and sToken structure offer a transparent and equitable process for asset management and investment, providing depositors with the confidence and assurance they need to make informed investment decisions.\

**REWARDS**\
\
&#x20;The Interest Rate on Loans: The interest rate paid by a borrower of an asset is typically distributed to depositors. The interest rate of an asset is calculated based on the utilization rate U. U=Total Borrows/Total Liquidity As the utilization rate (U) approaches 100%, there is a risk that depositors may not be able to withdraw their assets. This situation leads to an increase in the interest rate. For example, when an asset becomes scarce, it requires high-interest rates for repayments of loans and additional deposits.
