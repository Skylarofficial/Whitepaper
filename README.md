#### OVERVIEW

Base is currently experiencing a surge in DeFi activity, and we firmly believe that it has immense potential for the future. Our primary objectives are twofold. Firstly, we are determined to attract Total Value Locked (TVL) to Base by offering unbeatable yields without any impermanent loss. Secondly, we are committed to being the leading liquidity market by providing highly competitive incentives compared to other money markets, thanks to our native nature.

Skylar is a protocol that enables users to quickly and easily deposit and borrow assets on Base. Depositors can provide liquidity to earn interest as a stable passive income, while borrowers can leverage their assets without selling them. Skylar generates revenue through different reserve factors for various pools when users borrow from the liquidity markets. All of this revenue goes directly to the stakers.
