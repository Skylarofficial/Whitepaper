#### PROTOCOL FEES AND REVENUE

Skylar does not impose additional charges for lending, borrowing, or repaying assets. However, users may incur small transaction fees to compensate the validator network. The protocol generates revenue through a percentage of the loan interest rate, with a portion used to buy back $SKLR tokens from the market.

#### sTOKENS

Skylar supports various assets through interest-bearing derivative tokens called sTokens. These tokens are minted and burned whenever deposits and redemptions occur, representing the balance of assets supplied to the protocol. By holding sTokens, users earn interest as the exchange rate of sTokens increases relative to the underlying asset.

_Example:_\
If you supply 1,000 USDC to Skylar when the exchange rate is 1.2, you would receive 833.33 sUSDC. Later, if the exchange rate increases to 1.3, your 833.33 sUSDC would be worth 1,083.33 USDC.\

**INTEREST RATE MODEL**

Skylar's interest rate strategy is designed to manage liquidity risks and optimize asset utilization. The borrowing interest rates are determined by the Utilization Rate (U). When assets are readily available, a low-interest rate encourages borrowing. When assets are scarce, a high-interest rate encourages repayments and additional deposits.
